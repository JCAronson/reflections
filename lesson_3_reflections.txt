I would honestly ALWAYS rather have a remote repository,
rather than keep my files purely local, because I worship
at the alter of 'as many backups, in as many places as
possible'.  Hence my addiction to flash memory even given
it's rather terrible reliability/security.

Forcing manual remote pulls is a BEAUTIFUL feature
because it keeps you from accidentally overwriting a copy
of code that you want, just because you updated your
online repository wrong.  It also protects from malicious
or well-meaning outside sabotage by making sure you have
your own copy of the code that you can always use to 
reset the online one if it gets messed up.
