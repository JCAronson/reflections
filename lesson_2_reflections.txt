When you initialize the repository, it basically
does not a damn thing except give you a place to
put your stuff later.

The staging area gives you a perfectly safe area
to screw around with while you make sure you have
only what you want to save in the new commit.

Using the staging area to make sure you can commit
only one logical change is a matter of only staging 
one change at a time, regardless of how many changes 
you've actually MADE.

Branches seem like they would be very handy for keeping different
structural builds organized, like if you want to try out different
ways of approaching the problem then merge them into master if they
work.

The diagrams don't actually make a difference to me..
My brain does that for me.  Sorry.
